# Data Structures & Algorithms

A compact, hands-on collection of **linear** and **non-linear** data structure implementations in Python.

This repository includes examples for:
- Abstract Data Types (ADT)
- Singly Linked Lists (including recursive utilities)
- Binary Trees

---

## Repository Structure

- `ADT.py` — Abstract Data Type examples and simple interfaces  
- `linked_list.py` — Singly linked list with basic operations  
- `recursion_linkedlist.py` — Recursive linked list utilities (print, reverse, count, etc.)  
- `b_tree.py` — Binary tree with insertion and traversal methods  

---

## Features

- **Linked List (singly):**  
  Add/remove at head/tail, search/contain, traversal, iteration, and recursive helpers.  

- **Binary Tree:**  
  Node-based structure with preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals; includes utility functions like sum and count.  

- **Abstract Data Types (ADT):**  
  Pythonic interfaces demonstrating the idea of ADT abstraction and encapsulation.  

---

## Notes

- Each module can run independently (`python linked_list.py`, etc.)  
- Code written in Python 3.8+  
- No external dependencies
